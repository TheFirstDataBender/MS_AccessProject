# MS_AccessProject
This project was created to show my understanding of Microsoft Access.
I started this project by creating an ERD diagram and conceptual 

 A database was built using the ERD I designed, which includes tables with primary keys, all attributes/fields from the ERD, entities, proper data types, and field size selections. Forms have been created for at least one table per form, formatted in design view with changed header colors to make them easily understandable for the end-user data entry specialist, including at least one drop-down (combo) box on one form and a picture that changes when scrolling through records on one form. Five distinct queries have been created including 2 select, 1 delete, 1 calculated, and 1 parametric (using the specified names) and have been tested to ensure they run and display correct results. Four reports have been created based on the queries, formatted in design view to look presentable for a manager/boss and easy for the end-user to understand, with colors and formatting changed from the default templates. A Navigation Form/Switchboard has been created with links to all forms and reports and is set as the first form a user sees upon opening the database."
